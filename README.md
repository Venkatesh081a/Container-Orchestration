# Kubernetes Deployment, HELM Chart & Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline

## Overview

This project aims to develop Kubernetes deployment files for both frontend and backend components, ensuring seamless deployment and scalability. Additionally, a HELM chart is created to streamline the deployment process, allowing for easy configuration and management. Finally, Jenkins Groovy code will be written to automate the build and deployment process, ensuring consistency and efficiency in the CI/CD pipeline.

## Components

1. **Kubernetes Deployment Files**
   - Deployment files will be created for both frontend and backend applications, ensuring seamless scaling and management of pods.
2. **HELM Chart**
   - A HELM chart will be created to package the Kubernetes manifests and allow for easy installation, configuration, and management of the applications.
3. **Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Jenkins Groovy scripts will be used to automate the build, test, and deployment process of the applications, ensuring consistency across environments.

Kubernetes Deployment Files
Frontend Deployment
The frontend-deployment.yaml contains the configuration to deploy the frontend application. It includes specifications for:

Replica count
Container image
Ports for communication
Resources (CPU and memory requests/limits)
The frontend-service.yaml exposes the frontend application as a service, enabling communication between frontend and backend.

Backend Deployment
Similarly, the backend-deployment.yaml defines the backend application deployment settings, such as replica count, container image, and resource limits. The backend-service.yaml exposes the backend service to the frontend, ensuring connectivity.

Namespace
A namespace.yaml file is included to organize resources into a dedicated namespace for both frontend and backend components.

HELM Chart
The HELM chart is stored in the helm-chart directory and is structured to package and deploy the frontend and backend components.

Chart Structure
charts/: Contains any dependent charts, if needed.
templates/: Contains the Kubernetes YAML files as templates.
values.yaml: Defines the default configuration values for the frontend and backend components.
Use the following commands to install the Helm chart:

bash
Copy

# Install Helm chart for both frontend and backend

helm install <release-name> ./helm-chart

# Upgrade Helm chart if changes are made

helm upgrade <release-name> ./helm-chart
Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline
The Jenkins pipeline is designed to automate the build, test, and deployment process. The Jenkinsfile contains the pipeline script written in Groovy.

Pipeline Steps
Build:
Pulls the latest code from the repository.
Builds the frontend and backend applications.
Test:
Runs unit and integration tests for both frontend and backend components.
Deploy:
Deploys the applications to the Kubernetes cluster using the Kubernetes deployment files and HELM chart.
Notifications:
Sends notifications to Slack or email upon success or failure of the pipeline.
Sample Jenkinsfile
groovy
Copy
pipeline {
agent any

    environment {
        FRONTEND_IMAGE = 'frontend-image:latest'
        BACKEND_IMAGE = 'backend-image:latest'
    }

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                script {
                    echo 'Building frontend and backend images'
                    // Add build steps for frontend and backend
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                script {
                    echo 'Running tests for frontend and backend'
                    // Add testing steps
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                script {
                    echo 'Deploying to Kubernetes'
                    // Add Helm deployment commands
                    sh 'helm upgrade --install frontend ./helm-chart --set image.tag=${FRONTEND_IMAGE}'
                    sh 'helm upgrade --install backend ./helm-chart --set image.tag=${BACKEND_IMAGE}'
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Notify') {
            steps {
                script {
                    echo 'Sending notifications'
                    // Add notification steps (e.g., Slack, email)
                }
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        success {
            echo 'Build and deployment successful!'
        }
        failure {
            echo 'Build or deployment failed!'
        }
    }

}
Requirements
Kubernetes Cluster
Helm 3.x+
Jenkins 2.x+ with Kubernetes Plugin
Docker (for containerization of frontend and backend applications)
How to Run
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
Deploy the applications using Helm:

bash
Copy
helm install <release-name> ./helm-chart
Configure Jenkins pipeline by creating a new pipeline job, pointing to the Jenkinsfile in this repository.

Trigger the Jenkins pipeline to build and deploy the applications.
